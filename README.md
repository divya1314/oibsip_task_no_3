- Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
- Conducted data validation and reshaping operations.

## Data Analysis Techniques
- Explored the data through statistical summaries and distributions.
- Applied anomaly detection techniques using Isolation Forest.

## Data Visualization Techniques
- Utilized various plots including histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize data distributions, correlations, and patterns.

## Model Development
- Implemented models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost for fraud detection.
- Trained the models and evaluated their performance using cross-validation and various metrics.

## Model Evaluation
- Evaluated models based on precision, recall, F1 score, ROC AUC, and average precision score.
- Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates effective techniques for fraud detection using machine learning and data analysis. It provides insights into preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation strategies.
